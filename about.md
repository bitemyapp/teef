## I'm a software business consultant and avid Haskell hacker

I love building, working on, and marketing software products. Occasionally I post to my blog or announce a project.

I'm into search engine marketing (PPC and SEO) optimization lately.

## You might want to work with me if

You're building or maintaining an internal software stack, consumer product, or software-as-a-service product.

You'd like to know how best to scale your infrastructure or development process.

You want to introduce lean product development or iterative software development to your team.

You just want something built or maintained by somebody who loves hacking.

You need somebody with algorithms, product, commodity search, and API services experience.

You're toiling away on your startup and need a friend.
