# Stuff I've made

<ul class="projects">
      <li>
        <project>Blacktip</project>
        A distributed Haskell library and soon also HTTP service for k-ordered unique ids.
        Based on Boundary's Flake - but faster. :)

      <li>
        <project>Bloodhound</project>
        A Haskell client and DSL for querying, filtering, and indexing documents in Elasticsearch.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>Berossus</project>
        A Clojure service for querying and transacting into Datomic databases. Made at 
        Invitae with the assistance of my wonderful coworkers.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>Brambling</project>
        A Clojure library for managing migrations of Datomic databases. Currently the only
        way to do a full, arbitrary schema or data migration of a Datomic database.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>Blackwater</project>
        A Clojure library for logging SQL queries and the time they
        took for Korma and clojure.java.jdbc. Modeled after the query logging in Rails.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>Bulwark</project>
        A Clojure library for defending APIs and HTTP servers. Throttles requests to
        endpoints and allows you to ban IP addresses. Allows blacklisting and whitelisting.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>Scroot</project>
        Funky Django hack. Makes version controlled
        and audited high-value Django models possible
        in MySQL MyISAM. Created instead of reusing an
        existing module because MyISAM doesn't have
        real transactions. Done in a single weekend.

      <li>
        <project>Neubite</project>
        Clojure CMS. Uses MongoDB for storage.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>My Dotfiles</project>
        I often use this to teach people how to write Emacs
        Lisp or configure their vim editor. Trivially
        redeployable so that I can hack comfortably anywhere
        there's a *nix.

      <li>
        <project>Github Dark Theme</project>
        Started from somebody else's work that I can't track down from awhile
        back, it's a dark theme for Github that actually works. I modified it
        to not look horrible. Might need an update soon.

      <li>
        <project>Clone of the original Hacker Typer.</project>
        Funny little hack to clone Hacker Typer for Emacs instead of the web. Mine involved a lot less code ;)
        <a href="http://hackertyper.net/">
          Original hacker typer here!

      <li>
        <project>Thodol Wiki</project>
        Quickie micro-wiki. I wrote it for a friend who wanted
        something he could use but also hack on. I should rewrite
        it in Clojure soon.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>Django Pagination</project>
        Pagination for Django, forked because original
        creator disappeared and there were bugs. Until Django
        added official pagination support, this was the only
        shake-n-bake pagination module that worked.

      <li>
        <project>Redoot</project>
        Reddit bot that gets you to buy crap from Woot!

      Stuff I've worked on
    </h2>
    <ul class="projects">
      <li>
        <project>Revise</project>
        RethinkDB client library and DSL for Clojure. I only did about 10% of the work,
        mostly on the connection management side and with getting protobufs to compile. 
        I used it as an opportunity to explore an asynchronous and pipelined client library 
        that had no global singletons. Cesar did most of the work, especially
        concerning the DSL.
        <br><br>
        Currently the only RethinkDB client for Clojure.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>Korma</project>
        SQL client library and DSL for Clojure. I am a maintainer of and contributor to
        this project. Alex Baranosky is the primary maintainer.
        <br><br>
        I also wrote and edited the Korma chapter in Clojure Cookbook along with
        Yogthos (Dmitri Sotnikov).

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>EditHero</project>
        Editing and proofreading as a service. I made this with an old friend
        and colleague because I couldn't seem to get my copy edited on the internet
        without going through a lot of rigmarole. It has since been shut down, due
        to little in the way of revenue. Had a couple of happy, steady customers though.
      </li>
      <li>
        <project>SnappyWeather</project>
        Simple weather app, created because Google took down the iGoogle weather API.
        The app itself is down, but the weather API and data is available as a service.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>HNOfficeHours</project>
        Designed to allow people to offer advice/expertise, or seek
        people offering advice for a given problem/specialty. Includes
        scheduling and search. Fun weekend hack from 2.5 years ago.
        Now deprecated in favor of better alternatives.
